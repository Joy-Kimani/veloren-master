/// corresponds to the client using new addresses.
///
/// New addresses are checked against the existing IP bans. If a match is found
/// that client will be kicked. Otherwise, the IP is added to the set of IPs
/// that client has used. When a new IP ban is created, the set of IP addrs used
/// by each client is scanned and any clients with matches are kicked.
///
/// We could retain addresses of removed channels and use them when banning but
/// that would use a potentially unknown amount of memory (so they are removed).
