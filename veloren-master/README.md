## Welcome to Coping chronicles!

Coping chronicles is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. It is inspired by games such as Cube World, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft. The game is in active development and enjoys a flourishing player community.

## Development

Currently, most communication among contributors takes place on our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/coping chronicles-community-449602562165833758). Similarly, we provide a [Matrix server](https://matrix.to/#/#coping chronicles-space:fachschaften.org) as a more privacy-friendly alternative. You can join it to keep up with the game development, talk with the community or even contribute something yourself. Anyone who shows genuine effort to help is welcome to our team. You do not need to know how to code to contribute to the game!

Translators are welcome to contribute on our Weblate instance.

It is recommended to use [Airshipper](https://book.coping chronicles.net/players/airshipper.html), our official launcher, to keep your game up-to-date easily.
